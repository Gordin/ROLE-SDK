==================================================================
Short instructions on how to use the PLEShare2 REST-API and jquery
==================================================================

To deliver all necessary information, the present practicesharing-widget is 
making heavy use of PLEShare2 - a very stable and simple to use REST-based 
service. If you too want to interact with PLEShare2 (e.g. publish and/or 
retrieve activities/bundles), please have a look at the file 'myquery.js' in the 
'/js' directory. In this file, all the necessary methods can be found. To 
simplify matters, let me describe the first steps to facilitate your start in 
developing widgets using PLEShare2. Before we start, please visit the following 
web-resource where all available REST-calls are listed: http://augur.wu-
wien.ac.at/pleshare2/api-test.html. Be aware of that PLEShare2 can deliver all
information either in XML or in JSON-objects.

***************************** Step 1: Login to PLEShare (via PUT request)

function login(usr, pwd)

Parameters: usr - Username pwd - Password

Hence we are using asynchronous requests, the method "loginFinished" is taking
care  of storing the resultset of our request (username, sessionId and
sessionName) in  global variables for later use.

***************************** Step 2: Open an activity (Retrieve an activity
through PLEShare2; GET request)

function openActivity(nodeId)

Parameters: nodeId - the unique identifier of the node/activity

Please note, that you will have to send a cooky containing the sessionName as 
well as the sessionId in the header of your request.

***************************** Step 3: Publish an activity (Store an activity
in PLEShare2)

function publish(patternTitle, patternContent)

Parameters: patternTitle - the title of your activity patternContent - a
JSON-structure containing all data (tools, peers and outcomes) the activity
is consisting of.

*****************************

If you want to search for an activity, use the 'searchPatterns(searchterm)'-
method. If you want to get all activities created by a special user, use the 
'retrieveMyPatterns()'-method.

*****************************

The practicesharing-widget is using JQuery UI, please take a look at the 
JQuery UI-documentation for further instructions: http://jqueryui.com/demos/
