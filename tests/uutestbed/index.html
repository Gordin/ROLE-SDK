			<h1>Uppsala Testbed</h1>
			The tesbed will be performed within the distance course "Social software and Web2.0" with around 50 students. 
			The course is given during the summer semester in june and july and is supposed to correspond to 5 weeks of full time study. 
			An university wide LMS installation, "ping-pong", will be used  througout the course for the main interaction with the students.
			The course consists of four assigments corresponding of a individual and a group part each.
			<h2><a href="gadgets-assignment1.html">Assignment 1</a></h2>
			<p>This assigment is intended to introduce the students to the topics of the course by 
			reading provided articles and reflecting upon them from a few given questions.</p>
			
			<p>The group assignment is to discuss a few given questions regarding the future of the web, 
			take a stance originated in an article or two, argue and give feedback to others via comments or counter arguments.</p>
			
			
			<h2><a href="gadgets-assignment2.html">Assignment 2</a></h2>
			<p>This assignment (which might be the fourth of the course but for simplicity referred to as number 2) 
			is to look deeper into social interactions via twitter regarding a fixed topic. 
			The students are supposed to find patterns of behaviour and how the social interactions work in a specific
			medium (in this case microblogging and customer relations).</p>
	
			<p>The students are supposed to look into a twitter history timeline and discuss with each other via notes. 
			The tweets can be referenced in the notes by inserting links triggered via the inter-widget communication. 
			If a link is pressed at a later point the tweet is shown again in the content viewer, and perhaps also in the twitter history timeline.</p>
