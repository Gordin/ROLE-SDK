========================================================
     This is a distribution of the ROLE Project SDK
========================================================

RUNNING THE SDK
===============
1) Enter the "bin" directory and run the appropriate "start" command.
(There is a start.sh for UNIX-like environments and a start.cmd for
Windows.)

2) Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8073/
(Avoid using "localhost" instead of 127.0.0.1 since there are problems with
setting cookies on localhost in some browsers.)
You can log on with username "testuser" and password "roleabdc".
This SDK and all of its contents will be mounted at http://127.0.0.1:8073/role/
