ROLE-SDK
========

To build the SDK from SVN:
> cd path_to_role_svn_trunk
> mvn clean
> mvn package

The result is a zip file (there is also a .tar.gz version).
path_to_role_svn_trunk/assembly/target/role-m<x>-sdk.zip

Running the SDK:
1) Unpackage the zip file
2) Follow further instructions in the unpackaged README
