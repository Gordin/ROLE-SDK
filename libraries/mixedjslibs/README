A range of javascript libraries that should be available under the libs directory in a deployed webapp.
For example: http://somehost/libs/less/less-min.js

The output of this subproject is a war file that will need to be merged or overlayed when building the main webapp.

NOTE that the mvn pom file will download and include more files in the jar file than what is in the SVN, 
for example an requirejs adapted version jqueryui.
